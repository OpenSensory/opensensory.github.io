This is a work in progress detailing the concept of Pollinator Enhancement Collaborative (PECs). PCEs are envisioned as local, voluntary associations organized to increase the area and quality of pollinator habitat on working lands in the United States. The work is supported in part by [Regen Network’s 2022 Community Funding Program](https://medium.com/regen-network/congratulations-to-our-community-funding-program-awardees-50c023a21d8).

### Project Aim and Scope

Our aim with this project is to develop a template for pollinator enhancement collaboratives: legal entities linking stewards of working lands, conservation funders, and their local communities. Members of these collaboratives contribute resources, such as monitoring, knowledge, materials, and technology. They also support fundraising and research activities, with the aim to make it easier to start up projects in response to local needs.
Our initial test case will be to provide incentives for landscape stewards to plant appropriate habitat at times and in places where they otherwise would not be available, starting with fruit, wine grapes, and nursery products in Oregon’s Willamette Valley.

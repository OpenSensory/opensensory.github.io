# Operating Model

PECs will serve two roles: as an *institutional memory* and *automation agent* of its members. 

## As a store of institutional memory

A collaborative might cycle through the process below:

1. Organize. Identify ideas for on-the-ground projects and the people working on them.
2. Prioritize. Determine which projects to pursue, hold for further consideration, or pass along to another organization.
3. Plan. Turn membersâ€™ vision into realizable projects and programs.
4. Acquire and manage resources. Provide standardized, reusable tools for fundraising, provisioning, and payments for services.
5. Communicate. Tell the story of the projects to funders, colleagues, and communities.

## As an automation agent

This project will develop software to help reduce paperwork and data entry, and increase the ability to monitor projects and collaborate. Tools might be used to create work orders and job sheets, procure tools and materials, and streamline accounting and payments processes.

# Governance Technologies

Another element of the PEC concept is taking advantage of the possibilities of emerging governance technologies. 

## Participation

The first question is participation - anticipated members in a PEC include the following:

- Land stewards, such as growers, ranchers, and public lands managers
- Conservation funders: government, NGOs, and individuals
- Public agency representatives
- Horticultural and ecological consultants
- Researchers and Cooperative Extension specialists
- Interested citizens

## Organizational model

Inspirations for our work include:

- Arizmendi cooperative
- Dutch agri-environmental cooperatives
- Bioregionalism, watersheds, foodsheds
- Distributed digital organizations - DAOs, Value Flows, Open Collective
- Boundary organizations

Key takeaway: resource management, allocation

Information, funds, knowledge

Ecocredits (NOTE: payments not necessaryâ€¦incentives come in different shapes and sizes)

Transparency in decision making and finances

Funding model(s)

Putting it all together: A New Digital Cooperative

# Governance Technologies

Another element of the PEC concept is taking advantage of the possibilities of emerging governance technologies. 

## Participation

Anticipated members in PECs include the following:

- Land stewards, such as growers, ranchers, and public lands managers
- Conservation funders: government, NGOs, and individuals
- Public agency representatives
- Horticultural, landscape, and ecological professionals
- Researchers and Cooperative Extension specialists
- Citizens

## Organizational model

Inspirations for our work include:

- [The Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives](http://arizmendi.coop/)
- [Dutch agri-environmental cooperatives](https://www.boerennatuur.nl/english/)
- The extension of the concept of watersheds, such as [foodsheds](https://cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/194/2008/07/comingin1.pdf)
- Distributed digital organizations and economic collaboration networks - such as DAOs, [Valueflows](https://www.valueflo.ws/), and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
- Boundary organizations, such as the [California Ocean Science Trust](https://www.oceansciencetrust.org/our-work/)
- Multiple innovations in democratic voting mechanisms and market design

## A work in progress

The work on governance tech will get underway in March and April 2022 as the development team and community membership takes shape. The work is expected to cover questions about ecocredits for pollinator habitat enhancement, transparency in decision making and finances, and funding/resource allocation model(s)

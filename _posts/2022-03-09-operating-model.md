# Operating Model

PECs will serve two roles: as an *institutional memory* and *automated agent* of its members. 

From the perspective of a PEC as a store of institutional memory, a collaborative will need to perform the following roles:

-Organize. Identify ideas for on-the-ground projects and the people working on them.
-Prioritize. Determine which opportunities to pursue/not pursue, hold for further consideration, or pass along to another organization.
-Plan. Turn membersâ€™ vision into realizable projects and programs.
-Acquire and manage resources. Provide standardized, reusable tools for fundraising, provisioning, and payments for services.
-Communicate. 

One of the hypotheses animating this project is that an organization that loops through these activities on a daily (or other regular basis) will be able to more effectively deliver on its mission. Part of what will make this possible is the combination of enabling technologies. 

PEC members bring their expertise and resources to the collaborative. These could include:

-Developing habitat enhancement strategies
-Developing, validating, running, and updating habitat/pollinator models
-Providing monetary, knowledge, and human resources
-Monitoring habitat enhancement and pollinator populations
-Conducting socio-ecological research
-Developing and maintaining software
-Provide reporting services to funders, researchers, policy makers, and the public

From the perspective of an Agent/Manager, a PEC will not likely conduct the above activities directly. Instead, the PEC will issue work orders, job sheets, and other action items to members and contributors. Built into this role will be methods to verify the completion of activities, process payments for services and materials, tax reporting, and other administrative functions.
